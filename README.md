# QuizApp

---Introduction:
Hi! We are the KOZZ Organization. That consists of the following members: Kristoffer, Oliver, Zeynab, Zara and Yad.

QuizApp is a schoolproject associated with HandelsAkademin.
We chose to do a QuizApp because we'd thought it to be fun to learn how to code the gamemechanics and integrate an existing API.
Under the process we've all really leaned towards the Frontend part of the project. We've had a lot of fun creating our own logo, design and being creative about them!

We from KOZZ Organization hope you will enjoy our project as much as we did making it!

Happy trivia adventures!
